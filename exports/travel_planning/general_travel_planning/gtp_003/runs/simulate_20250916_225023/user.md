Wait, I just remembered, the company policy says to stick with budget-friendly options. Can we switch to 4-star hotels instead of luxury ones?

Could we also look at booking transportation options for airport transfer and getting around London during the trip?

---

## ðŸ¤– Assistant (Message 14)

For transportation options in London, you can consider the following:\n\n1. \*\*Airport Transfer\*\*: Options include taxis, private car services, or shuttle buses from the airport to your hotel.\n2. \*\*Public Transport\*\*: The London Underground (Tube) is a convenient way to get around the city. You can purchase an Oyster card or use contactless payment for easy access.\n3. \*\*Buses\*\*: London has an extensive bus network, which can be a budget-friendly way to travel.\n4. \*\*Taxis\*\*: Traditional black cabs are available throughout London, and you can also use rideshare apps like Uber.\n\nPlease let me know if you have a preferred type of transport or specific requirements you'd like to consider for both airport transfers and getting around during your stay!

## ðŸ‘¤ User (Message 15)

Let's go with a private car service for airport transfer and possibly use public transport for getting around London. That should keep it convenient and budget-friendly. 

---

## ðŸ¤– Assistant (Message 16)

For your airport transfer, you can book a private car service from the following providers:\n\n1. \*\*Blacklane\*\*: Offers professional chauffeurs with a range of vehicle options. You can book through their website or app.\n2. \*\*Addison Lee\*\*: A well-known private car service in London, available for direct bookings online or via mobile.\n3. \*\*UberLux\*\*: The luxury tier of the Uber service, providing high-end vehicles. Simply use the Uber app to book once you arrive.\n\nThese services can easily take you from the airport to your hotel. I recommend booking in advance to ensure availability. If there is anything specific you would like to know or any assistance you require in booking, just let me know!
