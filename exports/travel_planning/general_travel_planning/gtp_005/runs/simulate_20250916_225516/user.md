## ðŸ‘¤ User (Message 17)

Thanks for the suggestions! That all sounds great. I'll definitely check those out on my free days. 

Can you help me find hotels in each city? I need at least 4-star accommodations, preferably close to the business centers and airports.

---

## ðŸ¤– Assistant (Message 18)

To help you find hotels in each city, could you please confirm the following:\n1. How many guests will be staying?\n2. Do you have a budget per night for the hotels?\n3. Would you like to keep the same check-in and check-out dates as your itinerary for each city (3 nights in Singapore, 2 nights in Hong Kong, and 1 night in Tokyo)?

---

## ðŸ‘¤ User (Message 19)

Could you let me know how many guests will be staying in the hotels, your budget per night, and if you want to stick to the same check-in/check-out dates as the itinerary?

---

## ðŸ¤– Assistant (Message 20)

Iâ€™m still waiting for your input regarding the number of guests, your budget per night for the hotels, and whether to stick to the same check-in/check-out dates as outlined in the itinerary (3 nights in Singapore, 2 nights in Hong Kong, and 1 night in Tokyo). Once I have this information, I can start searching for suitable accommodations for you.

---

## ðŸ‘¤ User (Message 21)

Just me for the guest, and Iâ€™d like to keep it under $300 a night for hotels. Yes, letâ€™s stick to the same check-in and check-out dates as the itinerary.

---

## ðŸ¤– Assistant (Message 22)

It seems that the hotel search tool cannot accommodate bookings for dates beyond the current year, which includes your trip in April 2025. However, I can suggest hotels based on your criteria for each city. Would you like me to provide a list of recommended hotels that typically match your budget and preferences?

---

## ðŸ‘¤ User (Message 23)

Sure, yes, please go ahead and suggest some hotels based on my criteria. Thanks!
