Hey! So, just to confirm, you said you have an American passport, right? You'll need to check visa requirements, but U.S. passport holders can visit Japan for tourism without a visa for short stays. 

Now for hotels and flights, let me get some options within your budget. 

As for the time conversion, 10:00 AM in San Francisco is 2:00 AM the next day in Tokyo. 

Iâ€™ll start looking into the flights and hotels. ðŸ™‚
