Okay, for your family call at 9:00 AM PT on Nov 27, that will be at 12:00 PM ET in New York.

As for the hotel, Iâ€™ll look for a decent spot in Midtown. And just to clarify, what kind of evening event are you looking for? Maybe some theater?

## ðŸ¤– Assistant (Message 2)

Could you please confirm the check-in and check-out dates for the hotel in Midtown? Also, do you have any particular preferences regarding the hotel, such as budget, number of guests, or specific amenities? And are you specifically interested in a theater event for the evening, or would you like to consider other types of events as well?

## ðŸ‘¤ User (Message 3)

Yeah, check-in on Nov 26 and check-out on Nov 30. Theater sounds good for the evening, just let me know what options you find.

Got it! Iâ€™ll look for a Midtown hotel available from Nov 26 to Nov 30 and check out some theater options for the evenings. Just to confirm, what date would you like to attend the theater?

Which specific date would you like to attend the theater during your stay from November 26 to November 30?

Let's go with November 29 for the theater.

Just to clarify, November 29 works for the theater. Also, I need to correct the previous date I provided for the event. Instead of November 29, I meant to say November 30.
