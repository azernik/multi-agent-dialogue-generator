Yeah, sure! Iâ€™m looking at a 7-day retreat in Costa Rica starting June 1st, 2025, and ending June 7th, right? You want a wellness resort with daily yoga, meditation, healthy meals, and nature experiences. Anything specific youâ€™re thinking about for accommodation or activities?

Not really set on a specific location, but somewhere close to nature would be great! Just want to focus on yoga, meditation, and healthy meals. Maybe some spa stuff too.

I'm actually looking for a wellness resort, not just any hotel. Could you focus on that? I want daily yoga and meditation, plus spa treatments and nature activities. And I prefer organic vegetarian meals. Also, letâ€™s keep it more about relaxation, maybe reduce those activities to like 4-5 hours a day?
