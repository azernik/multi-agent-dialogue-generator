- The visa is usually valid for 90 days and allows for multiple entries.
- Make sure to apply a few weeks in advance to avoid any issues.

\*\*Health Clearances:\*\*
- A yellow fever vaccination certificate is required if you're coming from or have traveled through a country with risk of yellow fever.

Be sure to check the latest guidelines as they can change. Need help with anything else?
