What do you need help with? Are you planning a trip or event, and when are you looking to go?

I'm planning a family vacation to Orlando from June 15 to June 22, 2025.

What specific assistance are you looking for regarding your vacation in Orlando? Would you like help with hotels, attractions, or something else?

## ðŸ‘¤ User (Message 5)

I need help planning a family vacation that accommodates wheelchair accessibility, dietary restrictions, sensory needs, and fits within our budget of $8000. We're also looking for a place with a kitchen, and we want to make sure to include Disney World, Universal Studios, and a beach day.
