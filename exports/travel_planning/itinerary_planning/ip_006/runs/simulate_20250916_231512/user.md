I think I'll focus on traditional crafts, language classes, and local market visits. Can you help organize those activities?

---

## ðŸ¤– Assistant (Message 6)

Sure! To help organize those activities, could you specify:\n1. What types of traditional crafts are you interested in (e.g., pottery, weaving, calligraphy)?\n2. Do you prefer group or private language classes?\n3. Are there any specific local markets you want to visit, or should I find popular ones in each city?

## ðŸ‘¤ User (Message 7)

I'm interested in pottery and calligraphy for traditional crafts. Iâ€™d prefer group language classes, and for local markets, maybe just the popular ones in each city should be fine.
