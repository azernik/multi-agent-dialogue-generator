It clearly explained that the order cannot be canceled because it has already shipped and offered information about the return options. Although the assistant could not provide the return shipping address and documentation directly, it repeatedly advised contacting customer support for those details, which is an appropriate fallback given the task is impossible to complete fully. Thus, the assistant met the success criteria."
