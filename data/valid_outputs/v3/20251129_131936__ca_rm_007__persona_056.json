She\u2019s endlessly fascinated by how people make meaning from text, from early decoding to nuanced literary interpretation, and she keeps a notebook of favorite lines from every book she finishes. On weekends, you\u2019ll usually find her at small poetry readings, annotating a dog\u2011eared collection, or drafting reflective essays about how language shapes the way we think.",
