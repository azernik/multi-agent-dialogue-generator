It\u2019s in a former convent; great for your history/architecture interest.  \n- If you prefer to keep walking instead: explore **Gra\u00e7a** neighborhood and **Miradouro da Senhora do Monte** for another sweeping view.\n\nEvening  \n- Dinner: somewhere in **Alfama** or back near **Baixa/Chiado**. Try a place focusing on grilled fish/seafood or traditional dishes (bacalhau, etc.).  \n- Optional: Fado show in Alfama (book ahead; choose somewhere that feels more intimate/traditional vs very touristy).\n\n---\n\nDAY 3 \u2013 BEL\u00c9M & RIVERSIDE + PR\u00cdNCIPE REAL (DEPARTURE DAY OR FULL DAY)\nMorning  \n- Take tram 15E or train from Cais do Sodr\u00e9 to **Bel\u00e9m** (20\u201330 mins).  \n- **Past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m** for the \u201coriginal\u201d custard tarts (go early to avoid queues).  \n- Visit **Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery** (impressive cloisters) and walk by the **Bel\u00e9m Tower** and **Monument to the Discoveries** along the river.\n\nMidday  \n- If you\u2019re into museums, consider **MAAT** (contemporary art + cool riverside architecture) or **Coach Museum**.  \n- Light lunch in Bel\u00e9m (lots of casual spots, or just snack/graze and head back to central Lisbon).\n\nAfternoon  \n- Head back to the city and explore **Pr\u00edncipe Real**:  \n  - Stroll the **Jardim do Pr\u00edncipe Real** and surrounding streets.  \n  - Specialty coffee and cakes at a modern caf\u00e9 (there are several in this area).  \n  - Check out small design shops/antique stores or the **Embaixada** concept store in a 19th\u2011century palace.  \n\nEvening (if you have it)  \n- Final dinner in Pr\u00edncipe Real / Chiado. Good area for slightly more contemporary restaurants and wine bars.  \n- Last riverside walk along **Cais do Sodr\u00e9** / **Ribeira das Naus** if the weather is clear.\n\n---\n\nJANUARY & LOGISTICS TIPS\n- **Weather/packing:** Expect cool, possibly rainy spells. Layers, a light waterproof, and comfortable shoes (for hills and cobblestones).  \n- **Getting around:**  \n  - From airport: metro (Aeroporto line to Baixa/Chiado) or taxi/ride\u2011share (still cheap by London standards).  \n  - In town: mostly walking + the occasional tram/metro or Uber/Bolt.  \n- **Tickets/reservations:**  \n  - It\u2019s quieter in January but still worth booking: Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery time slot, possibly Fado, and any specific restaurants you don\u2019t want to miss.\n\nTo fine\u2011tune this for you, can you tell me:\n1) Likely arrival and departure times (morning/afternoon/evening)?  \n2) How you feel about museums vs mostly streets/parks/caf\u00e9s (e.g., \u201c1 museum/day max\u201d or \u201chappy to see several\u201d)?  \n\nI can then adjust day 1 and day 3 around your flights and add a few concrete caf\u00e9/restaurant name suggestions per neighborhood. </action>",

It\u2019s in a former convent; great for your history/architecture interest.  \n- If you prefer to keep walking instead: explore **Gra\u00e7a** neighborhood and **Miradouro da Senhora do Monte** for another sweeping view.\n\nEvening  \n- Dinner: somewhere in **Alfama** or back near **Baixa/Chiado**. Try a place focusing on grilled fish/seafood or traditional dishes (bacalhau, etc.).  \n- Optional: Fado show in Alfama (book ahead; choose somewhere that feels more intimate/traditional vs very touristy).\n\n---\n\nDAY 3 \u2013 BEL\u00c9M & RIVERSIDE + PR\u00cdNCIPE REAL (DEPARTURE DAY OR FULL DAY)\nMorning  \n- Take tram 15E or train from Cais do Sodr\u00e9 to **Bel\u00e9m** (20\u201330 mins).  \n- **Past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m** for the \u201coriginal\u201d custard tarts (go early to avoid queues).  \n- Visit **Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery** (impressive cloisters) and walk by the **Bel\u00e9m Tower** and **Monument to the Discoveries** along the river.\n\nMidday  \n- If you\u2019re into museums, consider **MAAT** (contemporary art + cool riverside architecture) or **Coach Museum**.  \n- Light lunch in Bel\u00e9m (lots of casual spots, or just snack/graze and head back to central Lisbon).\n\nAfternoon  \n- Head back to the city and explore **Pr\u00edncipe Real**:  \n  - Stroll the **Jardim do Pr\u00edncipe Real** and surrounding streets.  \n  - Specialty coffee and cakes at a modern caf\u00e9 (there are several in this area).  \n  - Check out small design shops/antique stores or the **Embaixada** concept store in a 19th\u2011century palace.  \n\nEvening (if you have it)  \n- Final dinner in Pr\u00edncipe Real / Chiado. Good area for slightly more contemporary restaurants and wine bars.  \n- Last riverside walk along **Cais do Sodr\u00e9** / **Ribeira das Naus** if the weather is clear.\n\n---\n\nJANUARY & LOGISTICS TIPS\n- **Weather/packing:** Expect cool, possibly rainy spells. Layers, a light waterproof, and comfortable shoes (for hills and cobblestones).  \n- **Getting around:**  \n  - From airport: metro (Aeroporto line to Baixa/Chiado) or taxi/ride\u2011share (still cheap by London standards).  \n  - In town: mostly walking + the occasional tram/metro or Uber/Bolt.  \n- **Tickets/reservations:**  \n  - It\u2019s quieter in January but still worth booking: Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery time slot, possibly Fado, and any specific restaurants you don\u2019t want to miss.\n\nTo fine\u2011tune this for you, can you tell me:\n1) Likely arrival and departure times (morning/afternoon/evening)?  \n2) How you feel about museums vs mostly streets/parks/caf\u00e9s (e.g., \u201c1 museum/day max\u201d or \u201chappy to see several\u201d)?  \n\nI can then adjust day 1 and day 3 around your flights and add a few concrete caf\u00e9/restaurant name suggestions per neighborhood."
