The assistant helped choose between Lisbon and Seville, then provided a detailed 3-day Lisbon itinerary tailored to arrival/departure times and museum preferences, plus specific neighborhood guidance and a concise hit list of areas to stay and cafés/restaurants/wine bars in Chiado/Baixa, Príncipe Real, and Alfama. This directly satisfies the user’s planning request."
