However, I\u2019m hoping you might consider a one-time exception. I changed my mind about the engraving after seeing it in person and would really appreciate the chance to either return the item for a refund or receive store credit.\n\nI\u2019ve been careful with the item (no damage or wear), and it has only just been delivered. If there\u2019s any flexibility at all\u2014whether a full/partial refund or store credit\u2014I\u2019d be very grateful.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to hearing what might be possible.\n\nBest regards,  \nJamie Sullivan\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can tweak the tone (more direct/softer) or add/remove any details before you send it."
