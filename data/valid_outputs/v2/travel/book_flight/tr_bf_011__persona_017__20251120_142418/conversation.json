From each of those hubs, search to DEN and COS  \nOn the same or next day:\n- SEA/PDX/SFO/LAX \u2192 DEN\n- SEA/PDX/SFO/LAX \u2192 COS  \n\nCheck United first (since you\u2019re already on them), but also Alaska (SEA/PDX\u2192DEN), Delta, AA, Southwest (on Southwest\u2019s own site).\n\nGoal:  \nFind *any* combo like:\n- 8\u201116: ANC \u2192 SEA (Alaska)  \n- 8\u201117: SEA \u2192 DEN or SEA \u2192 COS (United/Alaska/other)\n\nIf you find something like that that gets you in **before 8\u201122**, you can:\n- Book those separate legs, then\n- Cancel/change the 8\u201122 backup per its rules.\n\n3) Call both Alaska and United after you\u2019ve booked the backup  \nOnce you have the 8\u201122 United ticket in hand:\n\n- Call **United**:\n  - Ask if there\u2019s **any way** to move you earlier ANC\u2192DEN or ANC\u2192[hub]\u2192DEN using:\n    - Different routings,\n    - Mixed carriers/partners,\n    - Waitlists/standby options.\n- Call **Alaska**:\n  - Ask for *any* ANC\u2192SEA/PDX/SFO/LAX seat after 8\u201115, tell them you\u2019re willing to:\n    - Overnight,\n    - Take red\u2011eyes,\n    - Do long layovers.\n  - Then combine that leg with a separate hub\u2192DEN/COS ticket.\n\n4) How to decide between earlier COS vs DEN if you find something  \nIf you see:\n- COS on, say, 8\u201119, and\n- DEN on 8\u201121,\n\nThen I\u2019d:\n- Take **COS 8\u201119**, then:\n  - Rent a car / shuttle / bus to Denver (3\u20134 hours drive).  \n  Being back 2\u20133 days earlier is likely worth the overland hop.\n\nSo immediate next moves for you:\n\n1. **Right now**: book that ANC\u2192DEN United flight on 8\u201122 as your backup.  \n2. After it\u2019s booked, start checking:\n   - Alaska: ANC \u2192 SEA/PDX/SFO/LAX on 8\u201115\u20138\u201118.\n   - From those hubs: flights to DEN and COS on the following days.\n3. If you want, paste me:\n   - Any ANC\u2192hub flights you find (dates/times),\n   - Any hub\u2192DEN/COS options that look possible,\n   and I\u2019ll tell you which combo is safest and most sensible to book to beat 8\u201122."
