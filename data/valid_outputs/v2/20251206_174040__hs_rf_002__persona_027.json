I can\u2019t override that policy via tools, but I should still try to help: explain the situation clearly, suggest escalation options (e.g., service warranty, re\u2011inspection, complaint with provider), and ask if they want me to pursue any of those. No more tools are useful since refund calls will likely fail for the same reason.\n</think>\n<plan>\n1. Explain that the system\u2019s refund window has expired and I can\u2019t submit a standard refund request.\n2. Suggest practical alternatives: warranty/revisit, escalation with provider, documentation, and next steps.\n3. Ask how the user wants to proceed (e.g., request no\u2011charge follow\u2011up visit vs. formal complaint).\n</plan>\n<action type=\"say\">\nHere\u2019s what I found for your HVAC job:\n\n- Service: SRV-HVAC-002 (Climate Control Experts), \u201cAnnual HVAC maintenance\u201d\n- Completed: 2025-10-15\n- System refund policy: Refunds allowed only within 30 days of completion\n\nThe system refused a refund estimate with this error: the 30\u2011day refund window expired on 2025-11-14, and today is past that date. Because of that, I can\u2019t submit a standard refund request through this channel.\n\nThat said, you still have some options, especially since the original issue (AC not cooling, short cycling, uneven cooling) was not resolved:\n\n1. Request a no\u2011charge follow\u2011up visit  \n   Many HVAC providers will come back once at no charge when the same issue persists after service.  \n   - I can draft a clear request to Climate Control Experts summarizing:\n     - The original visit date and type of work\n     - That the same symptoms persist (short cycling, rooms still not cooling)\n     - That you are requesting a no\u2011charge diagnostic and correction visit instead of (or in addition to) a refund.\n\n2. Escalate as a service-quality complaint  \n   Even if a refund is outside the automatic window, a formal complaint can sometimes result in:\n   - A partial goodwill credit\n   - A discounted or free corrective visit  \n   I can also draft that complaint in strong but professional language for you to send via email or contact form.\n\n3. Documentation for leverage  \n   If you want to push harder (with the company, your card issuer, or local consumer protection), it helps to:\n   - Note dates: service date (2025-10-15), when you first noticed the issue was still there, and any follow\u2011up contacts.\n   - Take photos or short videos showing thermostat settings, room temperatures, and unit short cycling.\n   - Note the rooms that never get cool and approximate temperature differences.\n\nHow would you like to proceed?\n\n- Option A: Try to get a no\u2011charge follow\u2011up visit.\n- Option B: File a formal complaint and ask for an exception/refund or credit.\n- Option C: Prepare documentation to escalate outside the company.\n\nTell me which option you want (A, B, or C), and I\u2019ll write the exact message/email you can send, tailored to your situation.
