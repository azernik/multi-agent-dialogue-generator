I need an **emergency replacement card delivered to my hotel in La Paz, Mexico, before next Friday**.\u201d\n- \u201cI\u2019m willing to pay any express or courier fee. What\u2019s the **earliest date** you can get a physical card to my hotel in La Paz?\u201d\n\nIf they say yes:\n- Give them:\n  - Full hotel name and address\n  - Your name as a guest\n  - Check\u2011in/check\u2011out dates\n  - Room number (or \u201cGuest arriving [your name], departs [date]\u201d)\n  - Hotel phone number\n- Then call or email the hotel and say:\n  - \u201cI\u2019m expecting a courier delivery containing a bank card in my name. Please hold it at the front desk/safe until I pick it up.\u201d\n\n2) If they **can\u2019t** ship to Mexico or can\u2019t meet your Friday deadline:\nThen pivot immediately to:\n- \u201cIn that case, please put my replacement card on **expedited/rush shipping to my home in Monterey** so it arrives by or before next Sunday.\u201d\n- Confirm:\n  - Exact delivery date window\n  - Any express shipping fee\n  - That your home address on file is correct\n\n3) Quick reality check on timing\n- If they can **deliver to La Paz by Thursday or Friday**, hotel delivery is your best bet.\n- If earliest hotel delivery would be **after you check out**, choose **rush to Monterey** instead so it\u2019s there when you get home.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- Your hotel\u2019s full name and address, and\n- The bank/issuer name for this card,\n\nand I\u2019ll draft:\n- A short script to read to the bank rep, and\n- A short email/message to your hotel asking them to accept and hold the delivery for you."
