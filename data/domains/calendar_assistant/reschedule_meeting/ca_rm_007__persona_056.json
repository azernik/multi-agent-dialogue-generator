She wants to keep the same group of attendees but move the meeting later in the week, ideally Thursday early evening so teachers can attend after classes. She is comfortable with either in-person at Grant High or a Zoom meeting, but would slightly prefer Zoom to make it easier for teachers with long commutes. She may reference her teaching schedule at the university (evening Educational Psychology seminar on Wednesdays) and needs to avoid overlapping with that course."
