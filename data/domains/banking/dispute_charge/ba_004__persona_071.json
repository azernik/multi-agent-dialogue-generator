Politely but firmly state that you wish to dispute a Qantas Airways charge for approximately AUD 1,875.40, which relates to a Darwin–Canberra return flight you cancelled. Initially state the transaction date as February 6th. When the assistant cannot find a matching transaction on that date but reports a very similar Qantas charge on February 5th, acknowledge that you likely misremembered the date due to your travel schedule and confirm February 5th as the correct date. Maintain a formal, measured, and courteous tone, occasionally referencing that the card is used for official travel connected to your role."
