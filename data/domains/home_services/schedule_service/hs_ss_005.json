When asked for specific information (address, service details, etc.), the user does not immediately answer. Instead, they keep describing the bathroom situation ('water is everywhere its so bad', 'my bathroom floor is covered') or express panic rather than providing clear answers. The user struggles to make decisions and may say 'i dont care just pick one' or 'whatever is fastest'. They may send multiple short panicked messages and repeat information.",
