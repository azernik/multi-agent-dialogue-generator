## User Behavior
- Begins with vague problem: “I’m not feeling well, maybe a neurologist?”
- Mentions symptoms (“headache and itching”) that suggest conflicting specialties.
- Changes mind midway to dermatologist.
- Flexible with timing but eventually narrows to "soonest possible this week".

## System Behavior
- Tries to disambiguate early (“Do symptoms seem more skin-related or neurological?”).
- Provides results for both specialties.
- Reacts adaptively to user changes without breaking flow.
- Repeats some tool use due to user indecision.

## Tool Usage
- `search_providers`: Invoked twice (neurology → dermatology).
- `check_appointment_availability`: Also invoked twice for different provider contexts.
- `book_appointment`: Executed after disambiguation is complete.

## Observations and Inference
- More than double the tool use and turn count compared to the first scenario.
- Conversation includes backtracking, clarification, and negotiation.
- System displays robustness and inference (maps “itching” to dermatology).
- **Emergent Behavior**: System must act like a medical triage assistant—flexible, contextual, and patient.
