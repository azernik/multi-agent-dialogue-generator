## ðŸ‘¤ User (Message 1)

Hey, I need to find a doctor for some weird symptoms I'm having. Should I look for a neurologist?

---

## ðŸ¤– Assistant (Message 2)

Could you please describe the symptoms you are experiencing? This will help determine if you should see a neurologist or another specialist.

---

## ðŸ‘¤ User (Message 3)

Um, yeah, I've been having these weird tingling sensations and sometimes my vision gets kinda blurry. It's been freaking me out a bit. Think I need a neurologist?

---

## ðŸ¤– Assistant (Message 4)

Can you please provide your location (city or area) so I can find neurologists near you?

---

## ðŸ‘¤ User (Message 5)

I'm not really sure, maybe around New York or something? If there's a good one this week, that would be ideal.

---

## ðŸ¤– Assistant (Message 6)

## ðŸ‘¤ User (Message 7)

Uh, wait a sec. I'm starting to think this might actually be a skin issue, too. I've noticed some rashes lately. Should I maybe check with a dermatologist instead?

---

## ðŸ¤– Assistant (Message 8)

It sounds like seeing a dermatologist might be a better option, especially since you're noticing rashes as well. Would you like me to search for dermatologists in New York City? Also, can you confirm your location again or if NYC is fine for you?

---

## ðŸ‘¤ User (Message 9)

Yeah, NYC works! Can you find me some dermatologists available this week?

If so, please let me know your preferred day and time, as well as your name and phone number.

Actually, I'm not sure about the exact time. Can you just tell me the available times again?

## ðŸ‘¤ User (Message 13)

I'm still not sure, can I think about it and get back to you later?
