## User Behavior

- **Tone & Cooperation**: The user is polite, responsive, and follows prompts without delay.
- **Clarity**: Initial goal is well stated — looking for a flight from San Francisco to New York for next Friday.
- **Responsiveness**: Engages naturally with the system, answers clarifying questions (e.g., confirming "next Friday" is July 26).
- **Late-Stage Change**: Just before booking, the user casually says they now want to fly to Chicago instead of New York.

### Insight:
The user displays **high dialog engagement** and **low ambiguity** — until the very last step. This sudden change challenges the system’s planning assumptions and pipeline sequencing.

## System Behavior

- **Prompt Handling**: Parses and confirms user parameters (departure city, destination, date).
- **Flight Listing**: Queries flights using the correct `search_flights` parameters and provides a clear list of options.
- **Booking Transition**: Proceeds to booking flow cleanly once user selects a flight.
- **Flexible Recovery**: After the last-minute switch, it re-triggers flight search with updated city ("Chicago") and re-offers flight options — without losing composure.

### Insight:
The system shows **strong reactivity and resilience**. Despite being near transaction finalization, it correctly pivots without confusion or needing the user to restate everything.

## Tool Usage

1. **`search_flights`**
   - Used twice:
     - First with `"San Francisco" → "New York"` on `"2025-07-26"`.
     - Then again with `"San Francisco" → "Chicago"` after the user's destination change.
2. **`book_flight`**
   - Initially prepared for booking with the selected New York flight.
   - Deferred after the change; re-engaged with new flight list.

### Insight:
This is a great example of **non-linear tool flow**. Tools must be **idempotent and stateless**, able to be re-invoked as user decisions shift late in the pipeline.

## Summary Table

| Component | Observations |
|----------|--------------|
| **User** | Friendly, prompt, only disruptive at the final step. |
| **System** | Maintains graceful fallback, avoids error loops. |
| **Tool** | Reused cleanly, responds to changing input. |

---

## Emergent Behavior

- Systems should **allow deferred commitment** — collect all inputs but delay irreversible steps (like booking) until final user confirmation.
- LLMs must be trained or prompted to expect **mid-dialogue goal changes**, even from friendly users.

📌 **Recommendation**: Always include a “Confirm before book?” step, especially in travel, healthcare, or payment domains.
