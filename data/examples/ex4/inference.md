## üßç User Behavior
- The user is precise in stating their need:
  - Specialty: Cardiologist
  - Location: San Jose
  - Time: Tomorrow morning (8 AM ‚Äì 12 PM)
- Follows a linear thought process: requests, confirms, accepts available time.

## System Behavior
- Provides concise but informative responses.
- Responds with exactly the info needed for each step:
  1. Provider list based on specialty/location.
  2. Available slots after user selection.
  3. Booking confirmation.
- Does not over-clarify or require re-confirmation.

## Tool Usage
- `search_providers`: Called once with correct inputs.
- `check_appointment_availability`: Used precisely for selected provider/time range.
- `book_appointment`: Successfully called with validated user info.

## Observations and Inference
- The flow is efficient: ~3‚Äì4 turns total.
- Zero ambiguity led to direct tool mapping and minimal computational load.
- Good example of low-friction HCI where both user and system follow ideal protocol.
- **Emergent Behavior**: The system builds trust through precision and responsiveness.
