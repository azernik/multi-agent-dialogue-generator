&lt;think&gt;
The user wants to book an appointment with a cardiologist in San Jose for tomorrow morning. I need to first search for available cardiologists in that area and then check their appointment availability for the specified time. 
&lt;/think&gt;
&lt;plan&gt;
I will first search for cardiologists in San Jose to get a list of available providers. Once I have that information, I will check their availability for tomorrow morning between 8 AM and 12 PM. 
&lt;/plan&gt;

I have found three cardiologists in San Jose: Dr. Emily Tran, Dr. Robert Kim, and Dr. Sarah Lopez. Now, I need to check appointment availability for them tomorrow morning between 8 AM and 12 PM. I will start with the first provider, Dr. Emily Tran.
&lt;/think&gt;
&lt;plan&gt;
I will check the appointment availability for Dr. Emily Tran for tomorrow morning (8 AM - 12 PM). If she has available slots, I will proceed with that. If not, I will check the next providers sequentially. 
&lt;/plan&gt;

&lt;/think&gt;
