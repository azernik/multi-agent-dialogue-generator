      "age": 37,
      "hometown": "Portland, Oregon",
      "occupation": "Literacy Specialist and Reading Interventionist",
      "bio": "Rachel Donnelly is a literacy specialist in the Portland public school system, where she designs reading intervention plans and coaches teachers on how to support struggling readers. With a master’s in educational psychology, she’s fascinated by how the brain makes meaning from text and spends her evenings at small-press poetry readings or annotating whatever novel is on her nightstand. She’s the sort of person who genuinely enjoys talking about punctuation choices and why a single metaphor can change how a student understands a story.",
      "writing_style": "warm, thoughtful, clearly structured, conversational but grammatically polished, occasional literary references",
      "sample_messages": [
        "Could you send me the latest version of the reading log template? I want to tweak the reflection prompts so they invite more genuine responses instead of one-word answers.",
        "I’m planning a short session on how we teach inference—are you free Thursday after school to look at a few passages with me and see what trips students up?",
        "Yes, that time works for me. I’ll bring the draft rubric and a couple of poems so we can test whether the criteria actually match what we value in students’ interpretations."
